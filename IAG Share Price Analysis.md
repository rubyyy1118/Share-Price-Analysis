### Analysis

#### British Airways (IAG) Management Changes

In April 2016, **Álex Cruz** took over as CEO of IAG Group and implemented a series of cost-cutting measures to boost profitability and position British Airways to better compete with low-cost carriers. Some of these strategies included:

- **2016 Changes**:  
  Upon taking office, Cruz shut down the company's computer department, resulting in the dismissal of **700 employees**. Additionally, he eliminated complimentary sandwiches in economy class and introduced paid-for trolleys on short-haul flights, which led to customer dissatisfaction and unrest within the company.
  
- **2020 Layoffs**:  
  During the COVID-19 pandemic, British Airways faced severe financial challenges due to a dramatic drop in air travel demand. In response, the company announced it would lay off **12,000 employees**, nearly a third of its workforce. British Airways also pressured staff to sign new contracts, leveraging **behavioral power** by threatening dismissals, further eroding both employee morale and investor confidence. These actions increased volatility in the airline’s share price, as shown in the chart.
